config for repo locations

Archive agility.  Archive needs to specify (a) way to get versions
and paths in archive for dscs (b) unpriv pull location (c) priv
push location

Vcs-Git-Master: <commit>
  specifies commit hash corresponding to the thing uploaded
  optional commit hash corresponding to pristine tar??
