remote is dgit
  can do fetch thing?
  push is deliberately broken?

remote refs
  refs/dgit/<suite>
local refs
  refs/heads/<suite>
  refs/remotes/dgit/<suite>

Vcs-Dgit-Master: <commit>
  specifies commit hash corresponding to the thing uploaded
  optional commit hash corresponding to pristine tar??
