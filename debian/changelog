dgit (0.4~pre2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Mangle debian/<version> tags the way git-buildpackage does
    (as of git-buildpackage 0.5.5, 3c6bbd0f4992f8da).
  * Support dgit-distro.<distro>.keyid config option.
  * Revert change to ssh to alioth CNAME, as the recommended CNAME
    is to something with no write access to the fs and the new CNAME
    has not yet been set up.  This reintroduces #720172 :-/.
