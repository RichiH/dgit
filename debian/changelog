dgit (0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Include package name in tag message.
  * Create directory .git/dgit when needed during build.  Closes: #721428.
  * Add Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browser [Richard Hartmann].  Closes: #721404.
    These fields refer to the development branch, "master", on alioth,
    not to the dgit suite refs (which are not accessible to git clone).

dgit (0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reuse already-downloaded .orig files after checking their hashes.
    Closes: #720526.  (This introduces a dependency on Digest::SHA.)
  * Do not always pointlessly fetch the .dsc twice.  (That code was
    erroneously duplicated during editing, apparently.)
  * Remove DGET_UNPACK from the environment in case the user has set it.
  * Remove scary warning from Description.
  * When uploading to Debian, tell dput to upload to "ftp-master".  This
    avoids problems with derivatives whose dput has a different default.
    Closes: #720958.
  * Fix some bugs in dgit fetch --dry-run which made dgit push
    --dry-run often not work at all.
  * Update the local tracking branch for the dgit remote, when pushing.
    Closes: #720956.
  * Fix references in manpage to old Vcs-Dgit-Master field name.
  * Reorganise manpage sections to be in a more conventional order.
  * New manpage section on FILES IN THE SOURCE PACKAGE BUT NOT IN GIT.
    Closes: #721186.

dgit (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cope with packages with epoch.  Closes: #720897.
  * Improve error message for non-fast-forward push.  Closes: #720896.
  * New --ignore-dirty option to skip noncritical check.  Closes: #720895.
  * New --no-quilt-fixup option to suppress quilt fixup.  RTFM.
  * Add Closes line for #720595 to changelog entry for 0.11.

dgit (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Location of dgit-repos is now git.debian.org:/git/dgit-repos/repos.
    Closes: #720525.  The rename on the server side will break older
    versions of dgit.
  * Fix bug which would make quilt patch fixup fail if git status
    produced "M" lines.
  * Autogenerated quilt patch fixup patch Description contains several
    recent git commits, rather than implying that the patch corresponds
    exactly to the top git commit.
  * Use "ftp.debian.org" not "http.debian.net" as the default Debian
    archive.  (http.debian.net tends to defeat certain kinds of cacheing,
    and can also have more skew.)
  * dgit build uses dpkg-buildpackage; there is a dgit git-build
    for using git-buildpackage.  Closes: #720595.
  * Better error message for use of UNRELEASED suite.  Closes: #720523.
  * Do not canonicalise suite more than once.  Related to: #720526.
  * Fix a badly open-coded copy of check_not_dirty.  Closes: #720524.
  * Fix some bugs in building (eg build-source would fail to do the quilt
    fixup; the --clean check in build was wrong).
  * Add missing dependency on realpath.
  * git-build (git-buildpackage wrapper) does not bother canonicalising
    the suite if --git-ignore-branch is used.

dgit (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Create .pc/applied-patches - do not empty it (!)

 -- Ian Jackson <ijackson@chiark.greenend.org.uk>  Sun, 25 Aug 2013 00:51:50 +0100

dgit (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * New cleaning arrangements.
  * More comprehensive workaround for `3.0 (quilt)'.
  * In push, double-check the .changes against the changelog.
  * Better error when source package contains .git.  Closes: #720555.
  * Change our .dsc field name to `Dgit'.  Relevant to #720201.
  * Fix bug handling our synthetic merges when we see them in
    the remote suite branch.
  * `3.0 (quilt)' fixup creates .pc/applied-patches since modern
    dpkg-source creates it even though old ones didn't always.

 -- Ian Jackson <ijackson@chiark.greenend.org.uk>  Sat, 24 Aug 2013 18:49:02 +0100

dgit (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix comparison of archive's .dsc's hash and git branch head
    to DTRT.
  * When creating repos in dgit-repos (using the ssh-cmd method),
    copy _template rather than using mkdir and git init.
    Closes: #720522.
  * In push, do git fetch as well as archive fetch, or archive
    fetch can fail.

 -- Ian Jackson <ijackson@chiark.greenend.org.uk>  Fri, 23 Aug 2013 12:24:09 +0100

dgit (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * If dak ls, or rmadison, reports multiple versions, look for them
    all, and pick the newest .dsc that doesn't give 404.
  * Manpage formatting fix.
  * Name the local remote tracking branch remotes/dgit/dgit/<suite>
    so that we avoid a warning from git about ambiguous branch names.

 -- Ian Jackson <ijackson@chiark.greenend.org.uk>  Thu, 22 Aug 2013 18:29:10 +0100

dgit (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allow fetching when archive has out-of-date git hash in .dsc.
    Closes: #720490.

 -- Ian Jackson <ijackson@chiark.greenend.org.uk>  Thu, 22 Aug 2013 16:02:10 +0100

dgit (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable, as this version mostly works.  (All the RC
    bugs of which I'm aware are now properly represented in the BTS.)

 -- Ian Jackson <ijackson@chiark.greenend.org.uk>  Thu, 22 Aug 2013 15:38:00 +0100

dgit (0.4~pre2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Mangle debian/<version> tags the way git-buildpackage does
    (as of git-buildpackage 0.5.5, 3c6bbd0f4992f8da).
  * Support dgit-distro.<distro>.keyid config option.
  * Revert change to ssh to alioth CNAME, as the recommended CNAME
    is to something with no write access to the fs and the new CNAME
    has not yet been set up.  This reintroduces #720172 :-/.

 -- Ian Jackson <ijackson@chiark.greenend.org.uk>  Thu, 22 Aug 2013 15:31:17 +0100

dgit (0.4~pre1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Use dgit.debian.net vhost on alioth.  Closes:#720172.
  * Usage message.  Closes:#720085.
  * Provide "dgit sbuild".
  * Assorted manpage fixes and improvements.
  * Fail if a required config item is missing.
  * Much better error messages.
  * Better error checking when parsing RFC822-style control data.
  * Better checking that the supplied .dsc and debian/changes correspond.
  * Ordering improvement in push: don't add dsc field until git push done.
  * New --distro option (helps with unknown suites).
  * Bugfixes.

 -- Ian Jackson <ijackson@chiark.greenend.org.uk>  Thu, 22 Aug 2013 13:36:44 +0100

dgit (0.3) experimental; urgency=low

  * New version which appears to be able to sort of work at least
    some of the time.

 -- Ian Jackson <ijackson@chiark.greenend.org.uk>  Sat, 17 Aug 2013 09:18:04 +0100

dgit (0.2) experimental; urgency=low

  * New version which might actually work but probably won't.

 -- Ian Jackson <ijackson@chiark.greenend.org.uk>  Fri, 16 Aug 2013 16:52:17 +0100

dgit (0.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Initial experimental (partial) version.
