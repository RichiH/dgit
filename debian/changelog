  * New cleaning arrangements.

dgit (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix comparison of archive's .dsc's hash and git branch head
    to DTRT.
  * When creating repos in dgit-repos (using the ssh-cmd method),
    copy _template rather than using mkdir and git init.
    Closes: #720522.
  * In push, do git fetch as well as archive fetch, or archive
    fetch can fail.

dgit (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * If dak ls, or rmadison, reports multiple versions, look for them
    all, and pick the newest .dsc that doesn't give 404.
  * Manpage formatting fix.
  * Name the local remote tracking branch remotes/dgit/dgit/<suite>
    so that we avoid a warning from git about ambiguous branch names.

dgit (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

dgit (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable, as this version mostly works.  (All the RC
    bugs of which I'm aware are now properly represented in the BTS.)

dgit (0.4~pre2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Mangle debian/<version> tags the way git-buildpackage does
    (as of git-buildpackage 0.5.5, 3c6bbd0f4992f8da).
  * Support dgit-distro.<distro>.keyid config option.
  * Revert change to ssh to alioth CNAME, as the recommended CNAME
    is to something with no write access to the fs and the new CNAME
    has not yet been set up.  This reintroduces #720172 :-/.

dgit (0.4~pre1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Use dgit.debian.net vhost on alioth.  Closes:#720172.
  * Usage message.  Closes:#720085.
  * Provide "dgit sbuild".
  * Assorted manpage fixes and improvements.
  * Fail if a required config item is missing.
  * Much better error messages.
  * Better error checking when parsing RFC822-style control data.
  * Better checking that the supplied .dsc and debian/changes correspond.
  * Ordering improvement in push: don't add dsc field until git push done.
  * New --distro option (helps with unknown suites).
  * Bugfixes.

dgit (0.3) experimental; urgency=low

    some of the time.

dgit (0.2) experimental; urgency=low

 -- Ian Jackson <ijackson@chiark.greenend.org.uk>  Fri, 16 Aug 2013 16:52:17 +0100

dgit (0.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Initial experimental (partial) version.
